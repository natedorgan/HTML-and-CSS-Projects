# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Here are sample websites I made using HTML and CSS.

Example home page for a space travel company. Uses CSS styling, a navbar, image containers, and a form.

This page is an example home page for a movie theater styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components such as a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
