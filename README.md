# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Here are sample websites I made using HTML and CSS.

# Projects

[Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/natedorgan/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html)

# Space Station Site

Example home page for a space travel company. Uses CSS styling, a navbar, image containers, and a form.

# Movie Theater Site

This page is an example home page for a movie theater styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components such as a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
